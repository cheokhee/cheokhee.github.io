title: A farewell to Smalltalk
---

*Smalltalk*. The very word evokes strong passion from the devotees and puzzled looks from the rest.
After more than a decade as a Smalltalk developer, it is time to say goodbye.

Before I do that, I want to take a walk down memory lane.
The year was 1996. I was a C/C++ programmer when I came across a job posting in my previous company looking
for a Smalltalk developer. Intrigued, I requested a transfer and I was accepted.
Even though I was using C++ at the time, I didn't really get object-oriented programming.
The first few months of Smalltalk was rough. The syntax was not the problem.
It was the completely different way of looking at software development.
It was a paradigm shift. It was culture shock.
Once I got over the hump, it was pure joy.
I finally got it. I finally grokked object-oriented programming.

From that point on, learning a new programming language became a whole lot easier.
To expand my horizon, I learned other languages such as Lisp, Prolog, Ruby, Python.

That was when I realized Smalltalk was extremely influential in the design of
many other languages.

That is because learning a programming language is more than just knowing
the syntax. It is also the thought process.
