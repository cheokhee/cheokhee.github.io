title: A farewell to Smalltalk
---

*Smalltalk*. The very word evokes strong passion from the devotees and puzzled looks from the rest.
After more than a decade as a Smalltalk developer, it is time to say goodbye.

Before I do that, I want to take a walk down memory lane.
The year was 1996. I was a C/C++ programmer when I came across a job posting in my previous company looking
for a Smalltalk developer. Intrigued, I requested a transfer and I was accepted.
Even though I was using C++ at the time, I didn't really get object-oriented programming.
The first few months of Smalltalk was rough. The syntax was not the problem.
It was the completely different way of looking at software development.
It was a paradigm shift. It was culture shock. I wondered if I had made a mistake.
But I persevered. I eventually got over the proverbial hump.
At some point, the light bulb just clicked. I was no longer struggling.
I finally got it. I finally grokked object-oriented programming.

The more I used Smalltalk, the more I was amazed by the simplicity of
its syntax.
The rules are extremely simple and consistent. I can hold all the rules
in my head while programming. There is very little cognitive load.

Because I like Smalltalk so much, I have relocated several times
for Smalltalk jobs. Each relocation took me to a different state.
From the Eastern time zone to the Central time zone.
And now in the Pacific time zone.

The simplicity of Smalltalk syntax is really unsurpassed.

I have dabbled in several languages in the last few years.
Each one has its unusual syntax.
I must say Smalltalk is my favorite language because of its syntax.
From that point on, learning a new programming language became a whole lot easier.
To expand my horizon, I learned other languages such as Lisp, Prolog, Ruby, Python.

That was when I realized Smalltalk was extremely influential in the design of
many other languages.

That is because learning a programming language is more than just knowing
the syntax. It is also the thought process.
