title: A farewell to Smalltalk
---

*Smalltalk*. The very word evokes strong passion from the devotees and puzzled looks from the rest.
After more than a decade as a Smalltalk developer, it is time to say goodbye.

Before I do that, I want to take a walk down memory lane.
The year was 1996. I was a C/C++ programmer when I came across a job posting in my previous company looking
for a Smalltalk developer. Intrigued, I requested a transfer and I was accepted.
Even though I was using C++ at the time, I didn't really get object-oriented programming.
The first few months of Smalltalk was rough. The syntax was not the problem.
It was the completely different way of looking at software development.
It was a paradigm shift. It was culture shock. I wondered if I had made a mistake.
But I persevered. I eventually got over the proverbial hump.
At some point, the light bulb just clicked. I was no longer struggling.
I finally got it. I finally grokked object-oriented programming.

The more I use Smalltalk, the more I like it.
Because I like Smalltalk so much, I have relocated several times
for Smalltalk jobs. Each relocation took me to a different state
and a different time zone.

And that brings me to my current job. My employer is
in the home stretch of migrating our enterprise system
from Smalltalk to Java. The Smalltalk system will be shut down
soon. I have been writing less and less Smalltalk, and more and
more Java over the last few years.

I knew this day would come. I have long decided to face
the cold hard reality of facts: the lack of Smalltalk jobs where I live.
It no longer makes sense to relocate hundreds of miles for Smalltalk jobs.
Besides, I have become very comfortable with using a variety of languages.

Obviously, I have strong feelings for Smalltalk. Otherwise, I wouldn't
be writing this article. Smalltalk will always have a special place
in my heart. I love the simplicity of its syntax.
The rules are extremely simple and consistent. I can hold all the rules
in my head while programming. There is very little cognitive load.
It simply appeals to the minimalist in me.

More than anything, Smalltalk helped me grow as a developer.
Overcoming that first paradigm shift makes subsequent paradigm shifts
so much easier.
It also made me curious
about other languages. I have looked at many other languages.
Inevitably, I compare the syntax to Smalltalk's.
Of all the languages I looked at, the only one that comes
close to Smalltalk's simplicity is Lisp.

Anyway, life goes on.
Is this a permanent goodbye?
Who knows? We might cross paths again in the future.

Thank you Smalltalk. Thanks for making me a better developer.
Thanks for taking me to Silicon Valley, where I met my wife.
